A persistent object cache backend powered by Redis. Supports Predis, PhpRedis, Relay, replication, sentinels, clustering and WP-CLI.


== Description ==

A persistent object cache backend powered by Redis. Supports [Predis](https://github.com/predis/predis/), [PhpRedis (PECL)](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis), [Relay](https://relaycache.com), replication, sentinels, clustering and [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/).

To adjust the connection parameters, prefix cache keys or configure replication/clustering, please see [our wiki](https://github.com/rhubarbgroup/redis-cache/wiki).

= Object Cache Pro =

A **business class** Redis object cache backend. Truly reliable, highly optimized, fully customizable and with a dedicated engineer when you most need it.

* Rewritten for raw performance
* 100% WordPress API compliant
* Faster serialization and compression
* Easy debugging & logging
* Cache prefetching and analytics
* Fully unit tested (100% code coverage)
* Secure connections with TLS
* Health checks via WordPress & WP CLI
* Optimized for WooCommerce, Jetpack & Yoast SEO

Learn more about [Object Cache Pro](https://objectcache.pro/?ref=oss&amp;utm_source=wp-plugin&amp;utm_medium=readme).


== Installation ==

For detailed installation instructions, please read the [standard installation procedure for WordPress plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).

1. Make sure [Redis is installed and running](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart).
2. Install and activate plugin.
3. Enable the object cache under _Settings -> Redis_, or in Multisite setups under _Network Admin -> Settings -> Redis_.
4. If necessary, adjust [connection parameters](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/redis-cache/other_notes/).

If your server doesn't support the [WordPress Filesystem API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Filesystem_API), you have to manually copy the `object-cache.php` file from the `/plugins/redis-cache/includes/` directory to the `/wp-content/` directory.


== Connection Parameters ==

By default the object cache drop-in will connect to Redis over TCP at `127.0.0.1:6379` and select database `0`.

To adjust the connection parameters, client, timeouts and intervals, please see the [connection parameters wiki page](https://github.com/rhubarbgroup/redis-cache/wiki/Connection-Parameters).


== Configuration Options ==

The plugin comes with quite a few configuration options, such as key prefixes, a maximum time-to-live for keys, ignored group and many more.

Please see the [configuration options wiki page](https://github.com/rhubarbgroup/redis-cache/wiki/Configuration-Options) for a full list.


== Replication & Clustering ==

To use Replication, Sharding or Clustering, make sure your server is running PHP7 or higher and you consulted the [Predis](https://github.com/predis/predis) or [PhpRedis](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis) documentation.

Please see the [replication & clustering wiki page](https://github.com/rhubarbgroup/redis-cache/wiki/Replication-&-Clustering) for more information.


== WP-CLI Commands ==

To see a list of all available WP-CLI commands, please see the [WP CLI commands wiki page](https://github.com/rhubarbgroup/redis-cache/wiki/WP-CLI-Commands).


== Screenshots ==

1. Plugin settings, connected to a single Redis server.
2. Plugin settings, displaying recent response time metrics.
3. Plugin settings, showing diagnostic information.
4. Dashboard widget, displaying recent response time metrics.
